# Git Practice
## Article Link
The article **["How to Write a Git Commit Message"](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how)** by Chris Beams provides a thoughtful perspective on the importance of writing clear and meaningful commit messages.

## Reasons that I am interested in
### 1. Explain the "Why" Instead of Just the "How"
Many developers focus on describing *what* they did in a commit (e.g., `Fixed a bug` or `Updated function`), but Beams argues that a well-written commit message should explain the **reason** behind the change. This approach makes it easier for future developers (including yourself) to understand the context of a change without having to dig through code or issue trackers.

### 2. Structure Your Commit Messages Properly
A structured format improves clarity and maintainability. A good commit message should include:
- A short, meaningful **summary** (50 characters or less)
- A **detailed explanation** if necessary
- References to **related issues** or **PRs**

These best practices not only improve **collaboration** within teams but also make debugging and maintaining code significantly easier over time. Itâ€™s a great reminder that commit messages are not just a formality but an **essential part of software development**.

This article is interesting not only because of its topic but also because it is directly related to the exercise that we are all participating in. The insights from this article will also be useful to me for the remainder of this course and will help me maintain projects more smoothly. Thank you!
